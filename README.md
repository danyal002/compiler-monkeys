# Hardware Code For Facial Recognition Door Lock

This project was created in a team of 5 members. I was responsible for integrating various hardware components and making sure everything was running smoothly. I also wrote the code for the Arduino and the Python script. It utilizes the **Serial** library to send commands from the Raspberry Pi to the Arduino in real time. I also used the PiCamera library to take pictures and the **HTTPS** library to send the pictures to a **Flask** server.
